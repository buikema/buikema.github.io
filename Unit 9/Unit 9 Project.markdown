# Build a Responsive Page!
[Circuits Assignment 23](https://circuits.generalassemb.ly/student/26/assignments/23/)
So, you’ve got a website.

You’ve got a wireframe for how this page might appear on a mobile device.

Time to make it fully responsive.

In this project, we’re going to put the three main aspects of responsive design into action by adding fluid layouts, media queries, and ems to your website code.

## Step 1: Coding Your Page

In the last project, you created wireframes and received feedback from your mentor for what your responsive page will look like on a mobile browser. Now it’s time to put this design into action.

- Start by adding the viewport tag within your head tags. Your viewport will look like the following (you can adjust based on the browser width you’d like your page to respond to): metaname="viewport" content="width=..."
- Add at least two media queries to the bottom of your CSS. Some popular media query sizes include 320px (iPhone portrait), 480px (iPhone landscape), and 768px (iPad portrait); however, feel free to choose other sizes if you feel it helps your overall design. Think of it this way—you’ve defined the CSS that desktop browsers will render at the top of the page, now you need to include the CSS that your site will need to display well on other types of screens.
- With your media queries in place, it’s time to swap out your fixed layout with a fluid layout. Identify the areas within your CSS where you have elements that should respond differently to different screen sizes. This can include size of images and widths of elements (divs). Change these to percentages.
- Define fonts as ems in your CSS.

The process of changing all this code can be overwhelming, so we’ve included the source code from the Elk Design code challenge as a reference for you. Throughout the process, save and test your code frequently—this will help you to narrow in on the specific elements that you need to modify. Try resizing your browser to make sure your media queries are working properly.

As always, reach out to the course producer or your mentor with any questions.

## Step 2: Test Your Page!

Once you’ve completed modifying your code, upload your page to Github Pages. Then, head to [http://ipadpeek.com/](http://ipadpeek.com/) to test your website on horizontal and vertical orientations of a smartphone and a tablet. Take screenshots and send them to your mentor.
