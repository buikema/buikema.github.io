## Homeowners Association

Small website redesign for the homeowners association I live in. The old site is from the era of table layouts and I'm trying to build something responsive that will also meet any accessiblity needs within the current or future community.

### To Do Items

- continue to tweak responsive images (why are such large photos used on mobile?)
- fix avatar image sizes on Firefox
- link map image to full mapbox page
