## Homeowners Association

Small website redesign for the homeowners association I live in. The old site is from the era of table layouts and I'm trying to build something responsive that will also meet any accessiblity needs within the current or future community.

### To Do Items

- continue to tweak responsive images (why are such large photos used on mobile?)
- adjust figcaption on government photos at larger screen sizes (bigger and more padding by 768px 35.5em)
- create flex effects for local government images
- add government addresses to figcaptions
- fix Title sizing at various device sizes
- fix avatar image sizes on Firefox
- link map image to full mapbox page
