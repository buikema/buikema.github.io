			<h1>Behind The Brushes</h1>
			<img src="images/fifi-portrait.jpg" alt="Head shot of Fifi from Instagram" title="Fifi Portrait">
			<p><strong>When we think of the world of fashion</strong>, the first two things that come to mind are models and designers. Behind these people are the make up artists who play an important role as they enhance the model's beauty and complement the designer's creations. Fifi is sought out across the industry by photographers, models, and brides alike.</p>
			<p>Fifi grew up in Dallas, Texas with Eritrean immigrant parents. Being exposed to different cultures provided her with unique perspectives and inspirations, which had a direct influence on her body of work. Since 2008, Fifi has worked as a freelance makeup artist for <a href="#">Estee Lauder</a> and <a href="#">MAC Cosmetics</a> and works closely with her team. She frequently styles models for advertisements and represents the company at beauty and fashion events.</p>
