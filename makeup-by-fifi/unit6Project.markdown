# Unit 6 Project
## Makeup By 
For those of you that are ready, this is the Unit 6 project. (It will be the last time you two are working together, from here on out you'll be putting work into your own project :simple_smile: )

Now that you've completed making a homepage for your client, let's see what they have to say about it!

### Step 1: Notify your client
Send a link of your client's homepage back to them

### Step 2: Solicit feedback
Ask your client how they feel about the homepage you've designed for them. Make sure to ask what they would like changes ,and the following questions:
Will the homepage appeal to the site's visitors?
Is the information presented to your consumers to allow them to purchase your goods or services?
Does the page stand out against your competitor's pages?
Are your products represented well digitally?
Does the color scheme and style represent your restaurant/business?

### Step 3: Making Revisions
Based on your client's general feedback and the answers to the questioned listed above, make revisions to your original design. Make sure to create a copy of the code you originally sent  to the client, as you will be sending both to your mentor

### Step 4: Submission
Send a link of the first iteration of the homepage, the clients feedback and revision request, and link of the homepage that includes the revisions to your mentor.
