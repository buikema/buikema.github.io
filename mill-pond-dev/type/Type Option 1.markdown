# Type Option 1

## Project Outlook
The Mill Pond Animal Hospital has been open nearly 2 decades. It’s an independent veterinary hospital. The priorities for their site include a great improvement  of readability. The current site is overly-busy and distracting.  It also needs to convey professionalism. Something less formal than a law or financial firm, but their clients trust the lives of their pets. Signage used by the hospital combines serif and sans-serif type and I’d like to reflect that in the site.

## Libre Baskerville and Montserrat
Both typefaces have a high x-height , making them bold enough to stand up in titles and signs. Libra Baskerville brings a professional tone. It’s been used sparingly to avoid a formal look more appropriate bank or law firm. Montserrat is quite geometric, but not entirely, bringing it closer to Libra. The geometric aspect makes it very readable across most of the site body.
