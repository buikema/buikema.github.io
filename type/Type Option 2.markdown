# Type Option 2

## Project Outlook
The Mill Pond Animal Hospital has been open nearly 2 decades. It’s an independent veterinary hospital. The priorities for their site include a great improvement  of readability. The current site is overly-busy and distracting.  It also needs to convey professionalism. Something less formal than a law or financial firm, but their clients trust the lives of their pets. Signage used by the hospital combines serif and sans-serif type and I’d like to reflect that in the site.

## Rokkitt and Quattrocento Sans
