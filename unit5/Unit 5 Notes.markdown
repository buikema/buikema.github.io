# Unit 5 Notes

*Step 1: Define Your Audience/Tone*
Who will visit your site? What value does your website offer to its visitors?
What information has to be presented to your consumers to allow them to purchase your goods or services?
What can make you and/or your restaurant/business stand out against your competitors?
How are your food or other products represented digitally?
What colors represent your restaurant/business?

*Step 2: Identify Content*
Create a flow diagram in outline format of your website. Use the following questions as a guide:
Include two to four pages; give each web page a content-appropriate name?
What will be the purpose for each?
What should each page contain? Will there be textual content? Or just images?
Incorporate market research you conducted/the wireframes you developed in Unit 2 and the home page you designed in Unit 3.
Use this document as a reference for setting up your content.
