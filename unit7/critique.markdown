# Unit 7 - Critique
## Step 1
*Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?*
I don’t know if a specific website(s) inspired me, but I do come across many sites that have an overall layout similar to Mill Pond Animal Hospital. I’m reminded of fairly new sites (within 5 years maybe) for businesses, often web services, which employ a jumbotron style lead-in with graphics or large type. Animals make for such compelling photos that I really wanted a full viewport image to immediately communicate this is a vet hospital website.

*Which parts of the design are you most proud of?*

*What struggles did you encounter in your design process?*
I think type was one of the things I most struggled with. Being able to be critical about someone else’s choice of font is very different than being able to pair them effectively. I wanted

*Which struggles did you encounter during page development?*

*What did you learn from making your project responsive?*
I’m still catching up in projects, but I don’t think we’ve done that yet.

There is something incredibly compelling about Squarespace home pages ([Dreaming with Jeff ](http://squarespace.com/home/dreamingwithjeff/)is pretty great too.) I think it comes from their use of type and whitespace.
