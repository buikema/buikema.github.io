# Unit 7 - Critique
## Step 1
*Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?*
I don’t know if a specific website(s) inspired me, but I do come across many sites that have an overall layout similar to Mill Pond Animal Hospital. I’m reminded of fairly new sites (within 5 years maybe) for businesses, often web services, which employ a jumbotron style lead-in with graphics or large type. Animals make for such compelling photos that I really wanted a full viewport image to immediately communicate this is a vet hospital website.

*Which parts of the design are you most proud of?*
The overall flow of the page and content hierarchy are laid out well for the page. Contact info is prominent and a visitor quickly moves down the page to important sections for the business (New Patients and Services.) At the start I was not certain I would be able to substantially simplify the page, because the current site throws a ton at the user right up front.

*What struggles did you encounter in your design process?*
I think type was one of the things I most struggled with. Being able to be critical about someone else’s choice of font is very different than being able to pair them effectively. I wanted to bring a professional, confidence-worthy tone without getting so formal as to look like a lawyer or financial firm.
After class critiques, many talked about the tone of my site. Warming up the tone is definitely something I worked on after that session.

*Which struggles did you encounter during page development?*
Getting floats and layout between text, unordered lists, and images to work correctly was the most challenging. I tried in some places to move to flex-box for layout with css and found that to be a much more understandable solution. However, there were some scenarios with multiple columns where flex-box broke symmetries in the layout.

*What did you learn from making your project responsive?*
I’m still catching up in projects, but I don’t think we’ve done that yet.

## Step 2
### [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com/home/overview/)
There is something very compelling about Squarespace home pages ([Dreaming with Jeff](http://squarespace.com/home/dreamingwithjeff/) is pretty great too.) I think it comes primarily from their use of type and whitespace.
#### Typography
The site universally uses various treatments on the sans-serif Gotham. Bolds, caps, and black vs grey text creates the hierarchy between navs, titles, calls to action, and body copy. The thin, very large, call to action text is eye catching, but open and airy. That is consistent with the copious amounts of white space throughout the page.
