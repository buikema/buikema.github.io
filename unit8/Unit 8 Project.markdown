I wanted to look at and compare a number of websites that offer professional services or products for businesses that rely on client confidence or trust (clients donâ€™t choose a vet because they offer superior neutering, but because they trust the vet hospital.) I also looked at audubon.org to see how a major site dealt with animal photography in a mobile perspective.

My initial sketches for a responsive site are [here](https://github.com/swimmies4icarus/swimmies4icarus.github.io/blob/master/wireframes/unit8-mill-pond-sketches-portrait-long.PNG) and [here](https://github.com/swimmies4icarus/swimmies4icarus.github.io/blob/master/wireframes/unit8-mill-pond-sketches-landscape.PNG). There are some more detailed wireframes [here](https://github.com/swimmies4icarus/swimmies4icarus.github.io/blob/master/wireframes/ResponsiveHomePhone-ish.png).

Some priorities...
- Limit use of photos on mobile.
- Phone number should always be visible on page load (never hidden in menu.)
- Address and emails should link appropriately for phone apps.
